          <p>
            I feel great today :D<br />
            I’ve been working the entire day and haven’t got the urge to smoke
            even once. I took some small breaks before, even for a whole week or two when I 
            visited family that is not... ahem... very “stoner friendly”.
            But I was always somewhere else when I took a break. I think that 
            makes it easier to not think about smoking weed (but even there i barely could 
            wait to be by myself again and smoke some)
            Maybe this whole diary idea is a bit much...

            I think this is going to be easy<br /><br />
            It really helps that I just moved flats and want to have a clean
            room for once with no smoke lingering in the air.

          <p>
            I haven’t felt the urge so far<br /><br />
            Today I was a bit annoyed, because my internet at home isn't
            working. The technician came by to install my router, but due to a
            misunderstanding he left without doing anything. No biggy, I
            guess...<br /><br />
            I will cruise down this sober journey because I'm a responsible
            adult with enough willpower to change their habits (•̀ᴗ•́)و ̑̑<br /><br />
            Honestly, the only thing reminding me of smoking weed is this blog
            anyway (ಥ﹏ಥ)

            This sucks man... the misunderstanding from yesterday became so much
            worse.<br /><br />
            Since Germany is a fucking third-world country I'm not gonna have
            internet probably for the next month, because the technician is
            booked out until NEXT YEAR or something<br /><br />
            Guess I'm going to use my phone data to write this.<br /><br />
            Oh well. I hope this blows over quickly.<br /><br />
            I realised that since I smoke my joints with tobacco, I'm
            technically quitting TWO things at once (wow). I'm kinda proud of
            myself for that.

            Well… what can I say ?... I’m just… human. I finished the whole 2g
            yesterday so I have no more weed in the house. I think this will
            help me get back on track. But c'mon man…really ? No Internet AND no
            washing machine ? WTF am I supposed to do ? Sit around and watch
            paint dry ? Most of my free time IS watching or playing something
            online, smoking and washing my clothes I guess at least i dont need
            to wash my stuff so often since I'm not smoking…

            OK. After searching around on my phone today. I think I have found
            someone to buy a new washing machine from. It’s used, so its really
            affordable ^^ I hope it doesn't break so quickly, I’m really trying
            to save money. Actually there is something else bothering me, since
            I still dont have Internet at home. I got used to falling asleep
            with a youtube video on or something. Which I can't do right now if
            I want to save at least some of my phone data. Because of that I
            started to have some nightmares, and you know how hard it is for me
            to fall asleep after I woke up in the night.

            I wrote the guy online about the washing machine, we are going to
            meet up the day after tomorrow. I got a hand cart to transport it.
            Luckily the guy doesn't live far from me so renting a car for that
            seems like a waste of money. The Nightmares were worse tonight. I
            barely even slept 4 hours. And I could have sworn that there was a
            knock at my door that woke me up. I feel so stressed :( If only i
            could smoke a bit of weed… … NO ! This is the time where I need to
            prove myself. I will not make the same mistakes as before.

            Yesterday really felt like a challenge, I was so close to giving up
            again. Why am I like this ? Every time things get hard I fall back
            into some sort of addiction to comfort myself. I’m so pathetic… But
            ok… just keep focusing on the goal. I want to stay sober for the
            rest of the month at the very least. I think I will go to bed early
            today to catch up on some sleep.

            I went and got myself a washing machine today :)) It's an old
            toploader that creaks and howls like an old dog when it runs, but it
            WORKS ! And all that for just 30 euros !! The guy was a bit weird
            tho. When I rang the doorbell, he opened the door almost instantly
            like he was waiting there. He didn't have any furniture in the room
            behind him. He led me down the hallway to the bathroom where I
            passed the kitchen, and I swear, it was also completely empty ! I
            asked him if he was moving out or just moved in, and he just said
            he’s been living here for a long time. So weird Luckily I got the
            washing machine out quickly and went on my merry way. What an
            awkward encounter…

            Today was a good day again :D I really misjudged how much a fresh
            change of clothes can help your mental health :)) I think I will
            call the Internet technician later, maybe im lucky and he will be
            available. I’ve been listening to a lot of music on my phone lately
            which really helps a lot to pass the time or when the urge to smoke
            comes around…

            I can’t believe my luck ! The technician WAS available and he is
            coming next Thursday. i will finally have normal internet 🎉🎉🎉 It
            makes all the pain I've been going through worthwhile. You can't
            believe how exited I am to open a nice youtube video at night on my
            laptop and peacefully go to sleep. I had such weird dreams the last
            couple of nights. The washing machine guy was there and just smiling
            at me. You know those kinds of dreams where it's just an image the
            entire time ? I remember every detail of his face by now. It's
            probably some after effects of not smoking for 7 days now. Idk maybe
            I need to get outside and speak to some normal people.

            Outside was not a good idea :( The urge was almost unbearable. I
            went to a bar yesterday to get my mind off things and it was so bad.
            There were so many people smoking all kinds of things. Somebody even
            offered me a Joint, which I painfully declined. I get that people
            are just trying to have fun but they really should be more
            considerate of others who are going through a tough time. I felt so
            awkward and unsocial, by the end I just sat in a corner by myself,
            staring at this weird picture on the wall that the bar owner calls
            “decore”

            My phone keeps dying on me :( , maybe because its been running 24/7
            since I moved out of my old flat. But it doesn't need to for much
            longer, you wanna know why ? because tomorrow the technician finally
            comes 🎉 I’m so excited, you wouldn’t believe it honey. You really
            can’t imagine how much you can miss such a simple thing like working
            internet or fresh clothes. It really makes me so thankful to have
            you and the kids around. The nightmares are still there and they are
            just getting crazier. I wake up in the middle of the night to loud
            banging, i don’t know were its coming from, and by the time I get
            out of bed it stops. I know what you are thinking, it's not the
            washing machine.

            people how great this feels.

            Ok what the fuck was that ? I don't remember writing this the day
            before. My last memory was standing in front of my door and seeing
            this weird fucking guy. And what was that about going to the bar ?
            I’m pretty sure that I stayed home last night. I woke up this
            morning like normal in my bed, and there was a router near my door
            perfectly plugged in and working. How did this happen ? Did I black
            out ? FOR A WHOLE DAY ? What about the guy ? This is definitely not
            normal, I have to go to a doctor. But I think I missed work
            yesterday, I need to check in first…

            I’m on my way to the doctor right now. It seems I have completely
            skipped work 2 days ago. My boss was so angry with me, can’t he see
            that I’m struggling here ? What an asshole… I think i will continue
            this entry later when im back from the doctors - - I’m back home now
            and I’m writing this on my pc for the first time :) God, it feels so
            good to write on an actual keyboard. The doctor gave me a really
            strange exam today. He put a really long icepick to my neck and
            asked me “If my realities were out of bounds lately ?”. I asked him
            to clarify, to which he just said “Nevermind, you are probably to young
            anyways…” What did he mean by that ?

            Now, I’m 30 and still as much of a smoker as in my younger years.<br />
