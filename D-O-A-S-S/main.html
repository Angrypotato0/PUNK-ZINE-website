          <p>
            I feel great today :D<br /><br />
            I've been working the entire day and haven't got the urge to smoke<br />
            even once. I took some small breaks before, even for a whole week or<br />
            two when I visited family that is not... ahem... very "stoner<br />
            friendly".<br /><br />
            But I was always somewhere else when I took a break. I think that<br />
            makes it easier to not think about smoking weed (but even there i<br />
            barely could wait to be by myself again and smoke some)<br /><br />
            I truly hope I can do this, but I get anxious without it...

            I think this is going to be easy. It really helps that I just moved<br />
            <a href="subs/good.html">flats</a> and want to have a clean room for once with no smoke<br />
            lingering in the air.

          <p>
            I haven't felt the urge so far.<br /><br />
            Today just felt a bit annoying because my internet at home wasn't<br />
            working yet. The technician came by to install a new router,<br />
            unfortunately, there was a small misunderstanding and he left without<br />
            installing anything, typical german.<br /><br />
            I have to stay positive and I will cruise down this sobriety journey,<br />
            because I'm a responsible adult that has enough willpower to change<br />
            their habits.<br /><br />
            Honestly, the only thing that reminds me of smoking weed is this blog<br />
            anyway.

            This sucks maaaaan... the misunderstanding from yesterday became so<br />
            much bigger.<br /><br />
            Since Germany is such a shit country when it comes to<br />
            Internet stuff, I'm probably not gonna have usable internet for the<br />
            next month, because the technician is completely booked out until NEXT<br />
            YEAR !!!!<br /><br />
            Guess I will continue to use my phone to have some kind of internet at<br />
            least.<br /><br />
            I realised that, since I smoke my joints with tobacco, I'm technically<br />
            quitting TWO things at once (wow). I'm kinda proud of myself for that,<br />
            I'm battling two addictions at once over here.

            I finished the whole 2g yesterday so I have no more weed in the house.<br />
            I think this will help me get back on track.<br /><br />
            But c'mon man... really ? No Internet AND no washing machine ? WTF am I<br />

            OK. After searching around on my phone today. I think I have found<br />
            someone to buy a new washing machine from. It's used, so its really<br />
            affordable ^^<br /><br />
            I wrote him and we are going to meet up the day after tomorrow.<br />
            I hope it doesn't break so quickly, I'm really have to save money.<br /><br />
            I started to have some nightmares, and you know how hard it is for me<br />
            to fall back asleep after I find myself awake in the night.

            could have sworn that there was a knock at my door that woke me up.<br /><br />
            I feel so stressed :( If only i could smoke a bit of weed...<br /><br />
            ... NO ! This is the time where I need to prove myself. I will not<br />

            Yesterday really felt like a challenge, I was so close to giving up<br />
            again. Why am I like this ? Every time things get hard I fall back<br />
            into some sort of addiction to comfort myself. I'm so pathetic...<br /><br />
            But ok... just keep focusing on the goal. I want to stay sober for the<br />
            rest of the month at the very least.<br /><br />
            I think I will go to bed early today to catch up on some sleep.

          <p>
            I went and got myself a washing machine today :))<br /><br />
            It's an old front loader that creaks and howls like an old dog when it<br />
            runs, but it WORKS !<br /><br />
            And all that for just 30€ !!<br /><br />
            The guy was a bit weird tho. When I rang the doorbell, he opened the<br />
            door almost instantly like he was waiting there. He didn't have any<br />
            furniture in the room behind him. He led me down the hallway to the<br />
            bathroom where I passed the kitchen, and I swear, it was also<br />
            completely empty !<br /><br />
            I asked him if he was moving out or just moved in, and he just said<br />
            he's been living here for a long time. So weird<br /><br />
            Luckily I got <a href="subs/good.html">the washing machine</a> out quickly and went on my<br />
            merry way. What an awkward encounter...

            I can't believe my luck ! The technician WAS available and he is<br />
            coming next Thursday. I will finally have normal internet :DDDDDDDD<br />
            It makes all the pain I have been going through worthwhile. You can't<br />
            believe how excited I am to open a nice youtube video at night on my<br />
            laptop and peacefully go to sleep.<br /><br />
            I had such weird dreams the last couple of nights.<br /><br />
            You know those kinds of dreams where it's just an image the entire time ?<br /><br />
            I remember every detail of his face by now.<br /><br />
            It's probably some after effects of not smoking for 7 days now.<br />
            Idk maybe I need to get outside and speak to some normal people.

            Outside was not a good idea :(<br /><br />
            The urge was almost unbearable.<br />
            I went to a bar yesterday to get my mind off things and it was so bad.<br />
            There were so many people smoking all kinds of things. Somebody even<br />
            offered me a Joint, which I painfully declined.<br /><br />
            I get that people are just trying to have fun but they really should<br />
            be more considerate of others who are going through a tough time.<br /><br />
            I felt so awkward and unsocial, by the end I just sat in a corner by<br />
            myself, staring at this weird picture on the wall that the bar owner<br />
            calls "decore"

            I woke up this morning like normal in my bed, and there was a router<br />

          <p>
            I feel a bit better today, I had a cold. Things are going better now.<br /><br />
            But who gets a cold AFTER they went to a doctor ?<br /><br />
            I... feel so strange since my panic attack when the technician came...<br />
            its like I haven't been quite feeling like myself ever since<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
            There is an egg... i can feel it

              This is the story of how I tried to quit smoking weed.<br /><br />
              In my 20s I used to say "I will quit when I'm 30". Now, I'm 30 and<br />
              I'm still as much of a stoner as in my younger years.<br />
              I got so used to smoking every day and I can feel how my body is<br />
              slowly paying the price for it... my nose is permanently stuffed, I<br />
              have constant sneeze attacks and when I get a cold it knocks my lungs<br />
              out for a week.<br />
              It's time to change.<br /><br />
              This website is a manifest of my thoughts and feelings during this<br />
              turbulent time in my life. <br /><br />
